### Enhanced Features
- Rich terminal UI with colorful output and formatted tables
- JSON persistence with backup system
- Loading animations and confirmation dialogs
- Session Management (save and resume work context)

## Session Management Feature

This application includes a powerful session management system that allows you to save and resume your work context:

### Session Commands

- `stop [session_code]` - Save your current todo state with a session code
- `start [session_code]` - Resume a saved session by its code
- `sessions list` - Show all saved sessions
- `sessions delete [session_code]` - Delete a saved session
- `sessions info [session_code]` - Show detailed information about a session

### Session Auto-Detection

When you start the app, it will automatically detect if any sessions exist and prompt you to resume or start fresh.

### Session Code Requirements

- Must be alphanumeric only (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- No spaces or special characters allowed
- Length: 1-50 characters

## Tech Stack

## Constraints

- No persistence (data lost on exit)
- No external dependencies
- CLI interface only
- Single-user (no authentication)

## Architecture

The application follows a clear separation of concerns:
- `src/models.py`: Data structures (Task class, etc.)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `src/storage.py`: File I/O operations (JSON persistence and session management)
- `src/todo_manager.py`: Business logic for task and session management
- `src/ui.py`: Rich UI components and terminal output
=======
- `src/todo_manager.py`: Business logic for task management
>>>>>>> 64c2e05b398b06a7b7369f7b6fd3d597cb1340be
- `src/main.py`: CLI entry point and menu interface
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
