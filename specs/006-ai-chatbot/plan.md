# Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

**Branch**: `006-ai-chatbot` | **Date**: 2026-01-22 | **Spec**: [AI-Powered Todo Chatbot Specification](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-ai-chatbot/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an AI-powered conversational interface for task management using natural language processing. The system will utilize MCP tools for database operations, maintain statelessness through database persistence, and provide a seamless chat interface via OpenAI ChatKit. The architecture follows a stateless design where all conversation state is stored in the database, enabling horizontal scaling and server restart resilience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, TypeScript 5.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK, SQLModel, Next.js 16+, Better Auth
**Storage**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with three required models (Tasks, Conversations, Messages)
**Testing**: pytest, Jest, integration tests
**Target Platform**: Web application with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
**Project Type**: Web application (dual - frontend and backend)
**Performance Goals**: Chat response time < 3 seconds (95th percentile), MCP tool execution < 500ms per tool, support 100 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Stateless architecture, JWT authentication on all requests, user data isolation, no in-memory session storage
**Scale/Scope**: Support 100 concurrent users, horizontal scaling ready, server restart resilience

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All code must be generated by Claude Code from specifications
2. **Stateless Architecture**: No in-memory state - all conversation state persists in database
3. **MCP-First Design**: All operations through MCP protocol - no direct DB calls from agent
4. **Security & Privacy**: JWT authentication required on all requests, user data isolation enforced
5. **Technology Stack**: Must use specified technologies (FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK, SQLModel, Neon PG)
6. **Agent Behavior**: Must follow natural language understanding and response quality standards

**Structure Decision**: Selected dual structure (backend/frontend) as this is a web application with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend, with MCP tools managing database operations.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| MCP Protocol Layer | Clear separation of concerns between AI agent and data | Direct database calls would violate MCP-first principle |
| Stateless Architecture | Horizontal scaling and server restart resilience | In-memory sessions would not survive server restarts |
| Two separate services | Different technology stacks and deployment needs | Monolithic approach would complicate scaling and maintenance |
