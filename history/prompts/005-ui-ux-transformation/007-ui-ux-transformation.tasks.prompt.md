## Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for the UI/UX transformation of the Todo Web Application. The tasks are organized in 8 phases:

1. Setup phase: Initializing project with required dependencies and foundational UI components
2. Foundational components: Creating theme management system and reusable UI components
3. User Story 1 (P1): Enhanced User Interface with Dark/Light Theme
4. User Story 2 (P2): Landing Page Experience with Animations (5 sections)
5. User Story 3 (P2): Unified Authentication Experience with tabbed interface
6. User Story 4 (P3): Enhanced Todo Management Interface with animations
7. User Story 5 (P3): Responsive Design Across Devices
8. Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns: Accessibility, performance, and finishing touches

The task list contains 94 individual tasks with proper IDs, parallelization markers, user story labels, and file paths. Each task is specific enough to be executed independently while maintaining the critical constraint of preserving all existing functionality while only modifying styling, layout, animations, and visual components.
