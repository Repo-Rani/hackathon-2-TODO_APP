# Create Phase 2 Constitution

## Summary
Created a comprehensive constitution file for Phase 2 of the Todo app, transforming from a console application to a full-stack web application.

## Details
The user requested creation of a constitution for Phase 2: Full-Stack Todo App. I created a new file `phase-2-full-stack-app-constitution.md` that includes all necessary guidance for developing a modern, multi-user web application with persistent storage, authentication, and RESTful API architecture.

## Changes Made
- Created new constitution file with comprehensive Phase 2 requirements
- Defined architecture constraints for full-stack application
- Specified technology stack (FastAPI, Next.js 16, Neon PostgreSQL, Better-Auth)
- Outlined the 5 Basic Level features to be implemented
- Included security standards, performance benchmarks, and governance guidelines
