## Phase V – Cloud Deployment (DigitalOcean / DOKS)

The objective of Phase V was advanced cloud-native deployment, in which the Kubernetes
cluster was required to be deployed on a cloud provider (such as DigitalOcean DOKS),
along with the use of tools like Kafka and Dapr.

### Current Status

The **cloud deployment for Phase V (DigitalOcean Kubernetes – DOKS)** could not be completed.

### Reason

To deploy a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean, a **valid debit/credit card** is required.  
At this time, I do not have any **active debit or credit card available**, due to which
DigitalOcean account verification and DOKS cluster creation could not be completed.

### Work Completed Instead

- Successfully completed **local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube (up to Phase IV)**
- **Containerized** the application using Docker
- Properly **implemented and documented Helm charts and Kubernetes concepts**
- Thoroughly studied and understood **Phase V theoretical architecture, Kafka use-cases,
  and Dapr integration**

### Note

Once a valid payment method becomes available, the Phase V cloud deployment  
(DigitalOcean or any supported cloud provider) will be completed.

This limitation was purely due to **resource constraints**, not a lack of understanding  
or implementation capability.
