# Todo Console App (Phase I) Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)
NO manual coding - All code must be generated by Claude Code; Every feature must have a specification written first; Iterate on specs until Claude Code generates correct output; Maintain `/specs` folder with all specification history

### Architecture Constraints
In-Memory Storage: No database, no file persistence; Single Process: All data lives in Python data structures (lists/dicts); CLI Only: No web server, no GUI; Stateless Sessions: Data resets when program exits

### Code Quality Standards
Python Style: Follow PEP 8; Type Hints: Use type annotations for all functions; Clean Code: Descriptive variable names, short functions; Documentation: Docstrings for all public functions; Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs

### Technology Stack
Package Manager: UV; Python Version: 3.13+; Dependencies: Minimal (no external libraries for core functionality); Development Tools: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus

### Data Model Principles
Task Structure: Must include id, title, description, completed, created_at; ID Generation: Sequential integers (1, 2, 3...); Immutability: Task IDs never change once assigned; Status: Boolean completed flag (True/False)

### User Interface Principles
Menu-Driven: Clear numbered menu options; Input Validation: Always validate user input before processing; Feedback: Confirm every action with clear messages; Exit: Always provide way to exit gracefully

## Feature Completeness and Forbidden Practices
Must implement exactly these 5 features: Add Task, View Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark Complete; Forbidden Practices: No manual code writing, No database connections, No file I/O for persistence, No web frameworks, No complex dependencies, No intermediate/advanced features

## Development Workflow
Read specification before implementing ANY feature; Generate code based on spec that follows architecture; Validate generated code has type hints, docstrings, handles errors gracefully, follows PEP 8

## Governance
All implementations must follow the 5 basic features exactly as specified; No manual coding allowed - must use specs to generate; Code must have type hints, docstrings, and error handling; All 5 features must work according to specs
