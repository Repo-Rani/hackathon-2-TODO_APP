# Hackathon Todo - Phase 2 Full-Stack Web Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)
NO manual coding - All code must be generated by Claude Code; Every feature must have a specification written first; Iterate on specs until Claude Code generates correct output; Maintain `/specs` folder with all specification history

### Architecture Constraints
Full-Stack Application: Backend API (FastAPI) with Frontend (Next.js 16 App Router); Database Persistence: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM; Authentication: Better-Auth for secure user management; RESTful API: Standard HTTP methods and status codes; Multi-User Support: Isolated data per authenticated user

### Code Quality Standards
Python Style: Follow PEP 8; Type Hints: Use type annotations for all functions; Clean Code: Descriptive variable names, short functions; Documentation: Docstrings for all public functions; Error Handling: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses; Frontend Standards: Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for type safety

### Technology Stack
Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL; Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript 5.0+, Tailwind CSS; Authentication: Better-Auth; Package Managers: UV (Python), npm/pnpm (JavaScript); Development Tools: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus

### Data Model Principles
Task Structure: Must include id, title, description, completed, created_at, updated_at, user_id; ID Generation: Auto-incrementing integers with UUID option; User Isolation: Each task belongs to a single authenticated user; Status: Boolean completed flag (True/False) with timestamp; Soft Delete: Mark as deleted instead of removing from DB

### User Interface Principles
Modern Web UI: Responsive design with Next.js App Router; Authentication Flow: Login/Register with secure session management; Task Management: Intuitive CRUD operations with visual feedback; Real-time Updates: Reflect changes immediately in UI; Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines for usability

## Feature Completeness and Forbidden Practices
Must implement exactly these 5 Basic Level features: Add Task, View Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark Complete; Forbidden Practices: No manual code writing without specs, No in-memory storage, No unauthorized access to other users' data, No hardcoded credentials, No bypassing authentication

## Development Workflow
Read specification before implementing ANY feature; Generate code based on spec that follows full-stack architecture; Validate generated code has type hints, docstrings, handles errors gracefully, follows PEP 8 and TypeScript standards; Test authentication and authorization flows; Verify database schema and migrations

## Governance
All implementations must follow the 5 basic features exactly as specified; No manual coding allowed - must use specs to generate; Code must have type hints, docstrings, and proper error handling; All 5 features must work according to specs with proper authentication and database persistence; Multi-user isolation must be maintained
